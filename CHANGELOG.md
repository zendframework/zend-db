## 2.8.0 - 2016-04-12

### Added

- [#92](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/92) adds the class
  `Zend\Db\Sql\Join` for creating and aggregating JOIN specifications. This is
  now consumed by all `Zend\Db\Sql` implementations in order to represent JOIN
  statements.

  operations to UPDATE statements.

  to `AbstractTableGateway::update`; you can now pass an array of
  specifications via a third argument to the method.
- [#96](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/96) exposes the package as
  config-provider/component, but adding:
  - `Zend\Db\ConfigProvider`, which maps the `AdapterInterface` to the
    `AdapterServiceFactory`, and enables the `AdapterAbstractServiceFactory`.
  - `Zend\Db\Module`, which does the same, for a zend-mvc context.

### Deprecated

- [#71](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/71) updates the `Pgsql`
  adapter to allow passing the connection charset; this can be done with the
  `charset` option when creating your adapter.
- [#76](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/76) fixes the behavior of
  `Zend\Db\Sql\Insert` when an array of names is used for columns to ensure the
  string names are used, and not the array indices.
- [#91](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/91) fixes the behavior of
  the `Oci8` adapter when initializing a result set; previously, it was
  improperly assigning the count of affected rows to the generated value.
- [#95](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/95) fixes the `IbmDb2`
  platform's `quoteIdentifier()` method to properly allow `#` characters in

## 2.6.0 - 2015-09-22

### Added

- [#42](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/42) updates the component
  to use zend-hydrator for hydrator functionality; this provides forward
  compatibility with zend-hydrator, and backwards compatibility with
  hydrators from older versions of zend-stdlib.
- [#15](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/15) adds a new predicate,
  `Zend\Db\Sql\Predicate\NotBetween`, which can be invoked via `Sql`
  instances: `$sql->notBetween($field, $min, $max)`.
- [#22](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/22) extracts a factory,
  `Zend\Db\Metadata\Source\Factory`, from `Zend\Db\Metadata\Metadata`,
  removing the (non-public) `createSourceFromAdapter()` method from that
  class. Additionally, it extracts `Zend\Db\Metadata\MetadataInterface`, to
  allow creating alternate implementations.

### Deprecated

- [#27](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/27) deprecates the
  constants `JOIN_OUTER_LEFT` and `JOIN_OUTER_RIGHT` in favor of
  `JOIN_LEFT_OUTER` and `JOIN_RIGHT_OUTER`.

  second argument to `Zend\Db\Predicate\Predicate::expression()`, allowing it to
  be nullable, and mirroring the constructor of `Zend\Db\Predicate\Expression`.

### Fixed

- [#40](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/40) updates the
  zend-stdlib dependency to reference `>=2.5.0,<2.7.0` to ensure hydrators
  will work as expected following extraction of hydrators to the zend-hydrator
  repository.
- [#34](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/34) fixes retrieval of
  constraint metadata in the Oracle adapter.

  on EventManager in AbstractTableGateway.
- [#17](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/17) removes an executable
  bit on a regular file.
- [#3](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/3) updates the code to use
  closure binding (now that we're on 5.5+, this is possible).
- [#9](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/9) thoroughly audits the
  OCI8 (Oracle) driver, ensuring it provides feature parity with other drivers,
  and fixes issues with subselects, limits, and offsets.
