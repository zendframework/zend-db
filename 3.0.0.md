## Refactoring zend-db to use PHP 7.2+ and type hint feature

- Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter

Added `Adapter::factory()` to return an `Adapter` class based on an array of
parameters. Changed `Adapter::createDriver()` and `Adapter::createPlatform()`
in static protected functions. Added a second optional parameter
`DriverInterface $driver = null` to `Adapter::createPlatform()`.

- Zend\Db\Adapter\AdapterAbstractServiceFactory

We cannot use type hint because the usage of `Zend\ServiceManager\AbstractFactoryInterface`.

- Zend\Db\Adapter\AdapterServiceFactory

We cannot use type hint because the usage of `Zend\ServiceManager\FactoryInterface`.

- Zend\Db\Adapter\ParameterContainer

Removed `merge()`, added `mergeFromArray()` and `mergeFromParameterContainer()`.

- Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform

Changed `setDriver(DriverInterface $driver)` for all the following platforms:

    - Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\Mysql
    - Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\Oracle
    - Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\Postgresql
    - Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\Sqlite
    - Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\SqlServer

- Zend\Db\Sql\Platform\PlatformDecoratorInterface

`setSubject()` cannot be type hinted, since implementations use various types 

- Zend\Db\Sql\AbstractSql

`Zend\Db\Sql\Select::resolveTable()` returns an array where as its parent returns a string
